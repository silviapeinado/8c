  <h2 style="color:blue";>Our Mission</h2> hi hi hi
<p> Our contraption, the buzzer for the blind, is made to assist those who have gone blind with their adaptation to navigating the world by touch. The process of adapting to life without sight is already incredibly difficult, and we wanted to aliviate some of the stress of the process. Our buzzer will activate and buzz whenever an object or a wall is near it, to indicate that the user of the buzzer should move. This is to help the user of the product to learn layouts of new places or homes, without simple trial and error.</p>
<h2 style="color:blue";>How The Buzzer Works</h2>
<p>The buzzer is made up of only a few components that are simple to source and aquire: an Arduino Uno, a Time of Flight Sensor, and a wire ativated buzzer, along with some basic male-to-male and male-to-female wires. </p>
